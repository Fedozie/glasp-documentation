## General Information

### What is Glasp?
Glasp stands for [Greater Legacy Accumulated as Shared Proof](https://bit.ly/interview-with-glasp-cofounder).

It is a social web highlighter that allows its users to highlight and annotate quotes and ideas on web pages and also share them with others, without having to go back and forth between the web and a note-taking app.

It aims to solve the problem of knowledge inaccessibility where knowledge, insights and experiences are kept in only personal spaces such as note-taking apps, which no one might be able to access. Glasp remedies this issue by providing a free browser extension that lets you quickly capture online content with coloured highlighting options, which are then automatically curated to your Glasp homepage. These highlights can then be tagged, searched for, linked to, and shared on a variety of other platforms, including Twitter, Teams, and Slack.

By enabling collaboration and sharing of knowledge, Glasp aims to create a shared proof of knowledge that can be visualized and accessed by others, especially like-minded people, which would lead to insightful and thought-provoking content to deepen your knowledge and understanding.

### Availibility
Glasp is available on [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-summary-with-chat/nmmicjeknamkfloonkhhcjmomieiodli) and the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ng/app/glasp-social-web-highlighter/id1605690124?mt=12) as a desktop extension. 

It is supported on the following browsers: Chrome, Brave, Safari, Microsoft Edge and Vivaldi. Glasp is a browser extension so it wasn't designed to be used on mobile devices, however, you can access your profile, feed, and export highlights and notes when using a mobile browser.
